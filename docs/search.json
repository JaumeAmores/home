I received a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Computer vision in 2006, and have been in industry for more than 10 years, working both as individual contributor and technical lead in multi-disciplinary teams. I enjoy both the theoretical and practical aspects of Data Science, I like developing high quality software based on best practices, and have generated abundant intellectual property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPh.D. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2006\nM.Sc. in Machine Learning and Computer Vision | Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona | 2003\nB.Sc. in Computer Science | Universitat de Valencia | 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS Blocks | Write modular, compact, and decoupled data science pipelines.\nHP Search | Flexible experiment tracking framework."

    "text": "I’m a PhD candidate at SUNY-ESF, working on predictive modeling and visualization with a focus on natural systems. My current work focuses on using game engines as GIS to visualize large-scale landscapes with a focus on forested systems as a method for scientific communication and outreach. Past projects have focused on landscape and community ecology, and have included predictive models of forest biomass from remote sensing data and the landscape-level impacts of beaver within New York’s Adirondack State Park. In all of these projects I’ve worked to apply data science techniques to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical expert within my team.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog.\n\n\n\n\n\nState University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry\nSyracuse, NY\nPh.D. in Environmental Science | August 2020 - Present (Expected 2024)\nB.S. in Forest Ecosystem Science | August 2015 - December 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunifir: A Unifying API for Interacting with Unity from R.
